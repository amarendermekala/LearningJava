Streams
---------------------------
Map - Maps one object to other

Filter - filters out few objects based on some criteria

Reduce - Reduces the final result into some result based on reduce operation, SQL aggregation - count, min, max

What is a Stream ?
Stream is a java typed interface
Stream<T> extends BaseStream<T, Stream<T>>

WHAT DOES IT DO ?
Can process large and small amount of data efficiently

1. Parallelly processed, leverage computing power of multi core CPUs
2. Pipelined, to avoid unnecessary intermediary operations

Why can't collection be a stream ?
1. We don't want to change the way collection works

Stream is object on which we can perform operations
Object that does not hold data
Object that should not change the data it processes, since parallel
Object that can process data in one pass
Object optimized from the algorithm point of view
